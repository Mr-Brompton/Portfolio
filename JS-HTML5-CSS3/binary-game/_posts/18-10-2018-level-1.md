## The *Bi*nary Digi*t*

Binary is a method for storing data using a base 2 counting system.

Base 2 means each digit in a number can have two possible states.

The two digits we use are 1 and 0.

A single binary digit is called a 'bit'.

With a single bit we can represent two possible peices of information.

1 could be:
    > positive, 
    > on, 
    > true, 
    > yes or, 
    > its numerical value of 1.

0 could represent 
    > negative,
    > off,
    > false,
    > no or,
    >It's numerical value.
