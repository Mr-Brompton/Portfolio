		<h2>Variables</h2>
			<h3>What are Variables?</h3>
			<p>We can think of variables as a 'name' for our peices of <a href="../data/data.html">data<a>, we refer to these names as 'Identifiers'. We must give our data an identifier in order to use it later.</p>
			<p>Any type of data can be stored in a variable. If we pose "The question of life, the universe and everything?", The string could be saved as the variable(var) "myQuestion"</p>
			<p>The numerical answer to our question of course is 42 and this can also be stored as a variable(var) with the indentifier 'myAnswer' enabling us to call each peice of data wherever it is needed.</p> 
			<br />
			<h3>I Declare Thee... Variable!</h3>
			<p>In order to use a variable first we must declare it. This means we tell the console that: </p>
			<ol>
			<li> We are declaring a variable using the keyword [ var ].</li>
			<li> We are giving it an indentifier for example [ myName ].</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We can then assign the [ var ] [ myName ] a string using <br/>
			<center> [ myName = "Ted"; ] </center><br />
			Of course all of this can be done on one line. It should look something like this:<br />
			<center> [ var myName = "Ted"; ] </center></p>
			<p>Let's consider changing our name. Fred is much better than Ted. To change the value held inside a variable, we can use it's identifier [ myname ]to assign [ = ] the new value ["fred"]. Always ending with a semi-colon [ ; ]<br />
			<center> [ myName = "Fred"; ] </center>
			<h3>Using a variable.</h3>
			<p>It couldn't be simpler to use the data stored in a variable. Wherever you need it, just use it's identifier. For Example:
				<center> [ ("Hello world. My name is " + myName); ] </center></p>
				
			<h3>Task</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Start a new JS Project.</li>
					<li>In your main.js file, create a new var that stores your name.</li>
					<li>Declare another variable that stores your greeting. Something like [ "G'day Fella's. You can call me " ].</li>
					<li>Use [ alert ]* to display your greeting and your name by calling the variables. (*alert works much like document.write)</li>
					<li>Open your work in your browser and check its all good</li>
					<li>now practice changing the name and greetings variables. let's see what you can come up with.
				</ol>
			<h3>Hint</h3>
				<p>For this task you will need the following new code:
					<ol>
						<li>The keyword [ var ]</li>
						<li>The identifers [ myName ] and  [ myGreeting ] </li>
						<li>The assign symbol [ = ]</li>
						<li>The Data, this time in the form of a string [ "Dave" ].</li>
						<li>the [ alert ] command. This works much in the same way as [ document.write("dave"); ]. Just replac the command with [ alert("dave"); ] </p>
					</ol>
				<p>There are often many ways to complete a task and if yours works then it is fine. If you are still stuck view <a href="Tasks/task1.html" target="_blank">my greeting</a>. The code I used is printed below.</p>
