		<h2>Data</h2>
		<h3>Literal and Identifiers</h3>
		<p>Their are two ways of referencing data in JavaScript. There is <b>Literal data</b> - Typed directly into JavaScript and <b>Data Identifiers</b> - which are names that act as a reference for the data it is assigned to.</p>
		<p> "Matt"<br /> 30<br /> true<br /> null<br /> are all examples of Literal Data.</p>
		<p>myName = "Matt";<br /> myAge = 30;<br /> myAim = true;<br /> myBrain = null;<br /> are examples of how to declare identifiers. Once an identifier is declared it can be used in place of the Literal Data.</p>
		<p>In JavaScript Identifiers must not use <a href="JSreservedWords.html">reserved words</a>. The first character of an Identifier must be a letter [A], underscore [_] or a dollar [$] while any subsequent characters may also include numbers.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Task</h3>
		<p>Build a New Webpage and use document.write and identifiers to introduce your name, age, something about you that is true and something that you don't have as null.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Hint</h3>
		<p>In order to complete this task you will be using both Literal data and data Identifiers. You will also need [+] and a [&#060;p&#062;] opening and closing tag</p>
		<p>There are often many ways to complete a task and if yours works then it is fine. If you are still stuck view <a href="tasks/task1.html" target="_blank">my paragraph</a>. The code I used is printed below.</p>
